## Who are you? 🔍
For now, I'm someone who loves to dive deeper into subjects that catch my interest. I've taken on many projects to expand my knowledge and skills. 
I also enjoy helping others understand concepts that I’ve already mastered, creating a win-win situation — they can make progress, and I get to reinforce my knowledge by teaching and explaining to others.

## What are your interests?
Consider there are many field in tech, for now i do have at least 3 of field that catch my interest, there are:
<ol>
  <li> <b>Data Science & Machine Learning</b> </li> 
I have always enjoyed discovering patterns in events within a given case, as it provides deeper insights into the subject. With Data Science and Machine Learning, I can explore data, uncover valuable insights, and build models that can predict or classify various outcomes <br>

 <li><b>UI/UX & Front-end Development</b></li>
I am highly interested in visually appealing designs, which is why I enjoy creating things that are not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing. Front-end development allows me to bring those designs to life, transforming them into interactive and user-friendly applications. (But to be honest, iam new to this field 😓. But still I am eager to learn and explore more.) <br>
