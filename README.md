## Who are you? 🔍
For now, I'm someone who loves to dive deeper into subjects that catch my interest. I've taken on many projects to expand my knowledge and skills. 
I also enjoy helping others understand concepts that I’ve already mastered, creating a win-win situation — they can make progress, and I get to reinforce my knowledge by teaching and explaining to others.
